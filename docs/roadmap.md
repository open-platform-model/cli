## 1. Current Status

OPM's CLI foundation has been built over the first iteration of development. The following capabilities are working today:

**Core definitions and rendering:**

- CUE-native definitions: Module, ModuleInstance, Component, Resource, Trait, Policy
- Catalog of definitions: 5 resources, 20+ traits, 5 blueprints
- 6-phase render pipeline with AST-based overlay generation
- Kubernetes Provider with 12 transformers (Deployment, StatefulSet, DaemonSet, Job, CronJob, Service, PVC, ConfigMap, Secret, ServiceAccount, HPA, Ingress)

**CLI commands:**

- `opm module init` — scaffold a new module (simple, standard, advanced templates)
- `opm module vet` — native CUE SDK validation with custom error formatting
- `opm instance build` — render an instance file to manifests
- `opm instance apply` — server-side apply with inventory tracking and stale resource pruning
- `opm instance delete` — inventory-based or label-based discovery with instance name or UUID
- `opm instance diff` — compare an instance file against live cluster state
- `opm instance status` — health and readiness status (table/yaml/json, watch mode)
- `opm instance tree` — tree view of instance resources and hierarchy
- `opm instance events` — Kubernetes events for instance resources
- `opm instance list` — list deployed instances in a namespace (`-A` for all namespaces)
- `opm config init` — initialize `~/.opm/config.cue`
- `opm config vet` — native CUE SDK config validation

**Infrastructure:**

- Instance Inventory — Secret-based resource tracking with change history and stale resource pruning
- Deterministic instance identity via UUID v5 labels
- CUE-native configuration with full precedence chain (Flag > Env > Config > Default)
- Values validation against module `#config` schema during build
- Unchanged apply detection — skips inventory write when nothing changed
- Provider auto-resolution when a single provider is configured
- Styled terminal output with charmbracelet/log and lipgloss
- CUE registry integration (`opmodel.dev`)
- OCI distribution design
- Kind cluster lifecycle tasks for local development

Design documents for upcoming milestones are maintained in `docs/rfc/`.

## 2. Phase 1: Application Model and CLI

Full lifecycle management of applications using the CLI. This is the current focus. Everything in this phase must be solid before the controller (Phase 2) can build on it.

### Dependency Graph

The milestones within Phase 1 have the following dependency relationships. M1 is the foundation — M2, M3, and M4 can proceed in parallel once M1 is complete, though each has internal dependencies shown below.

### M1: CLI Stability and Validation

The foundation must be solid before adding new capabilities. This milestone focuses on replacing stubs with real implementations, fixing correctness bugs, and filling gaps in the existing command surface.

**Major deliverables:**

- ~~**Native validation** — Replace the stub `opm module vet` and `opm config vet` commands with native Go CUE SDK implementations. 4-phase validation pipeline with custom error formatting, entity summaries, `--debug`/`--values`/`--package`/`--concrete` flags.~~ (done)

- ~~**`#ModuleInstance.values` validation against `#Module.#config`** — During processing, validate that the values provided in a ModuleInstance satisfy the schema defined by the Module's `#config`. Leverages CUE's evaluator to support mandatory (`!`), optional (`?`), and default (`*`) fields.~~ (done)

- **Atomic apply** — An incorrectly configured instance must not partially apply. Today, `opm instance apply` renders all resources and validates before applying, but a failure mid-apply does not roll back previously-applied resources. Investigate dry-run validation or rollback strategies.

- ~~**Unchanged apply detection** — When `opm instance apply` is run against an already-applied instance with no changes, the output indicates that no changes were made instead of displaying "Instance applied."~~ (done)

**Additional deliverables:**

- `opm module eval` — print the raw CUE evaluation of a module
- ~~`opm instance list` — list deployed instances in a namespace (`-A` for all namespaces), leveraging inventory for discovery~~ (done)
- ~~`opm instance tree` — tree view of instance resources and resource hierarchy~~ (done)
- ~~`opm instance events` — Kubernetes events for instance resources~~ (done)
- ~~`opm instance status` v2 — improved health reporting, inventory-aware~~ (done)
- ~~`--ignore-not-found` flag for `opm instance delete` and `opm instance status` for idempotent operations (exit 0 when no resources match)~~ (done)
- ~~`--create-namespace` flag for `opm instance apply`~~ (done)
- ~~Remove `injectLabels()` — redundant with transformer-based label injection~~ (done)

### M2: Secrets and Config Lifecycle

Full lifecycle management of configuration and sensitive data. This is the critical path for making OPM usable for real applications — without secrets support, every non-trivial application requires manual workarounds.

**Major deliverables:**

- ~~**Instance Inventory** — A lightweight Kubernetes Secret that tracks which resources belong to a ModuleInstance. Enables automatic pruning of stale resources during `opm instance apply` and provides a precise source of truth for `diff`, `delete`, and `status`. Maintains change history for future rollback.~~ (done)

- **Sensitive Data Model** — Introduce `#Secret` as a first-class type that tags fields as sensitive at the schema level. This single annotation propagates through every layer — module definition, instance fulfillment, transformer output — enabling the toolchain to redact, encrypt, and dispatch secrets to platform-appropriate resources (K8s Secrets, ExternalSecrets, CSI volumes). Supports literal values, external references, and CLI `@` tag injection.

- **Environment and Config Wiring** — Full `#EnvVarSchema` with four source types (literal, configMapKeyRef, secretKeyRef, fieldRef), bulk injection via `envFrom`, volume-mounted secrets, and auto-discovery of secrets from `#config`. This is the output side of the Sensitive Data Model's data flow.

- **Immutable ConfigMaps and Secrets** — When `immutable: true` is set, the transformer appends a content-hash suffix to the resource name and sets `spec.immutable: true`. Content changes produce a new name, triggering workload rolling updates. Old resources are garbage collected via the Instance Inventory. The OPM equivalent of Kustomize's `configMapGenerator`.

### M3: Distribution

OCI-native module distribution — the ability to publish, discover, and consume modules from registries. This makes OPM usable as a package manager, not just a local build tool.

**Major deliverables:**

- **Module distribution** — `opm module publish` (push module to OCI registry), `opm module get` (pull module), `opm module update` (update dependencies), `opm module tidy` (tidy CUE module dependencies without the external `cue` binary). Uses oras-go for OCI, Docker `config.json` for auth. Strict SemVer only — no `@latest`. *(openspec change: distribution-v1)*

- **Template distribution** — `opm template list`, `get`, `show`, `validate`, `publish`. Replaces the V1 embedded templates with registry-distributed templates. V1 templates remain during transition. *(openspec change: templates-v2)*

**Additional deliverables:**

- `opm config update` — extract current values, initialize latest config schema, reapply values. Helps users upgrade configuration across breaking changes.
- CUE-native CRD vendor — import Kubernetes CRDs into CUE using `cue import openapi`, similar to `timoni vendor crd`
- Rework tests to use CUE AST and pure CUE files for test data and comparison, eliminating string-based test fixtures

### M4: Rendering Pipeline Maturity

The rendering pipeline is the heart of OPM. Every future capability — the controller, the platform registry, multi-provider rendering — depends on a deterministic, composable, well-tested pipeline. This milestone hardens the pipeline and adds the extensibility required for Phase 2.

**Major deliverables:**

- **Staged apply and delete** — Wait for resource readiness before proceeding to dependent resources. Investigate whether staging should be configurable in the model (as a Policy or per-component).

- **Interface Architecture** — `provides`/`requires` model for typed contracts between components. Transforms OPM from a deployment tool into an application description language. Service communication, data dependencies, and infrastructure requirements expressed as typed contracts.

- **Policy definitions** — First-class `#Policy` / `#PolicyRule` enforcement with block/warn/audit semantics across the rendering pipeline. Policies are evaluated at render time, ensuring violations are caught before resources reach the cluster.

**Milestone exit criteria:** The rendering pipeline must be deterministic (same input always produces same output), composable (modules compose without implicit coupling), and thoroughly tested. This is the stable foundation that Phase 2's controller will embed.

---

## 3. Phase 2: Kubernetes Controller

The same Module lifecycle as the CLI, delivered through an in-cluster controller and a custom resource. This phase marks the transition from developer tooling to platform infrastructure. The controller uses the same CUE rendering pipeline as the CLI, so behaviour is identical whether you apply from your laptop or the controller reconciles in-cluster.

### M5: In-Cluster Controller

The core controller that watches ModuleInstance custom resources and reconciles them.

**Preliminary deliverables:**

- ModuleInstance CRD definition and controller scaffolding
- Embed the Phase 1 rendering pipeline — same CUE evaluation, same transformer matching, same output
- Continuous reconciliation — drift detection and re-apply to maintain desired state
- Controller-based status reporting via CRD status subresource and Kubernetes events
- Multi-cluster topology — target multiple clusters and namespaces from a single ModuleInstance definition, with override policies for per-cluster customisation

### M6: Platform Registry

A curated catalog of providers and modules, managed by Platform Operators, ready for consumption by end-users.

**Preliminary deliverables:**

- PlatformRegistry as a CUE-defined catalog — declares which providers handle which capabilities
- Provider and module curation — Platform Operators select and approve modules for their environment
- Platform-level policy enforcement — organisational policies applied across all deployments
- Discovery — "What can I deploy? Which providers support it?"
- Beginning of the Platform Model — the ability to describe the whole platform, not just individual applications

---

## 4. Phase 3: Platform Model

The full realisation of the multi-provider platform. Providers register standardised capabilities, Platform Operators assemble environments from multiple providers, and end-users deploy against abstract interfaces without knowing which provider fulfills each capability. For the complete vision, see [The Open Platform Model: Vision and Ecosystem](vision/opm-ecosystem.md).

### M7: Commodity Interfaces

Standard service interfaces that any conforming provider can implement, creating a level playing field where providers compete on quality, price, and reliability rather than API lock-in.

**Preliminary deliverables:**

- Commodity service interface definitions — CUE schemas for StatelessWorkload, StatefulWorkload, VirtualMachine, DatabaseAsAService, ObjectStorage, DNS, LoadBalancer, MessageQueue, KeyValueStore, CertificateAuthority
- Provider certification model — machine-verifiable proof that a provider's implementation satisfies a commodity interface
- Cross-provider contracts for networking, identity and access control, and observability
- Multi-provider rendering pipeline — a single ModuleInstance producing resources across multiple providers, each handling the capabilities it's registered for

### M8: Multi-Provider Ecosystem

The ecosystem where customers assemble their infrastructure from multiple service providers, each contributing different capabilities to the same environment.

**Preliminary deliverables:**

- Multi-provider marketplace with discovery and selection
- Provider onboarding and certification pipeline
- Cross-provider observability and monitoring aggregation
- Governance and compliance framework across providers
- Community-contributed commodity definitions and provider implementations
