## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Render provenance annotation

When the applied render's module bytes did not come from pure registry resolution — the main module is a local directory, or the main module's `cue.mod/local-module.cue` contains any local-path `replaceWith` — the CLI SHALL include the annotation `module-instance.opmodel.dev/source: local` in its spec apply. When a later apply resolves fully from registries, the CLI SHALL omit the annotation so server-side apply removes it. The annotation is a fail-closed provenance signal: the thin-editor apply path refuses a module that resolves from local bytes, and any future transfer of an instance to operator ownership reads it as a refusal; no CLI-executor-mode gate SHALL read it as an authority.

#### Scenario: Local render stamps the annotation

- **WHEN** an apply renders from a local module directory
- **THEN** the CR SHALL carry `module-instance.opmodel.dev/source: local`

#### Scenario: Replacement in effect stamps the annotation

- **WHEN** an apply's main module has a `cue.mod/local-module.cue` with a local-path `replaceWith`
- **THEN** the CR SHALL carry `module-instance.opmodel.dev/source: local`

#### Scenario: Registry apply clears the annotation

- **WHEN** an instance carrying the annotation is re-applied with fully registry-resolved modules
- **THEN** the annotation SHALL no longer be present on the CR
