## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Pre-apply existence check on first install

On first-time apply (no previous inventory), the system SHALL check each rendered resource against the cluster. If a resource exists with a `deletionTimestamp` (terminating), or exists without OPM labels (untracked), the apply SHALL fail with a clear error message. This check SHALL be skipped entirely when a previous inventory exists. A caller MAY pass an explicit admission set of resources; a resource in that set SHALL pass the untracked-resource test, and SHALL still fail the terminating-resource test. Only `opm operator install` SHALL pass a non-empty set, holding exactly the existing resources it proved came from an earlier opm-operator release manifest, or that already carry the operator instance's identity; every other caller SHALL pass none. No flag SHALL fill the set. The untracked-resource error SHALL NOT name a flag that would bypass it, since no flag does; it SHALL tell the user to remove or rename the existing resource, or to change the module so it renders a different name.

#### Scenario: Untracked resource detected on first install

- **WHEN** performing a first-time apply
- **AND** a rendered resource already exists on the cluster without OPM labels
- **THEN** the command SHALL fail with an error indicating the resource is untracked

#### Scenario: Terminating resource detected on first install

- **WHEN** performing a first-time apply
- **AND** a rendered resource exists on the cluster with a `deletionTimestamp`
- **THEN** the command SHALL fail with an error indicating the resource is terminating

#### Scenario: Check skipped when inventory exists

- **WHEN** performing a subsequent apply (previous inventory exists)
- **THEN** the pre-apply existence check SHALL be skipped entirely

#### Scenario: Untracked-resource error names no bypass flag

- **WHEN** performing a first-time apply
- **AND** a rendered resource already exists on the cluster without OPM labels
- **THEN** the error SHALL NOT mention `--force`
- **AND** the error SHALL tell the user to remove or rename the existing resource, or to change the module to render a different name

#### Scenario: Admitted resource passes the untracked test

- **WHEN** performing a first-time apply of the operator instance from `opm operator install`
- **AND** a rendered resource exists without OPM labels, and install proved it came from an earlier operator release manifest
- **THEN** the check SHALL NOT fail for that resource

#### Scenario: Admitted terminating resource still fails

- **WHEN** performing a first-time apply with an admission set
- **AND** an admitted resource exists with a `deletionTimestamp`
- **THEN** the command SHALL fail with an error indicating the resource is terminating

#### Scenario: Other commands admit nothing

- **WHEN** `opm instance apply` performs a first-time apply
- **AND** a rendered resource already exists on the cluster without OPM labels
- **THEN** the command SHALL fail with an error indicating the resource is untracked
