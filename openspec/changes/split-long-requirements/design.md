## Context

The cli has 215 long requirements in 59 main specs. The rules below follow the swarm guide for this rewrite (design/T2.1.md of the swarm folder, approved 2026-10-19). The numbers in brackets point to that guide's sections. Nothing here changes the meaning of a requirement or scenario, and no code changes.

## Research & Decisions

### Which form rewrites a requirement
**Context**: A requirement over 500 characters can be shortened in four safe ways, and several unsafe ones pass the validator without keeping the rules (guide section 3).
**Explored**: Archive output of each form in scratch copies (guide sections 3 and 5).
**Options considered**:
1. Form a, MODIFIED with a shorter body and more scenarios: keeps the header and every scenario name. Fits examples, lists and formats around one behavior.
2. Form b, MODIFIED plus ADDED: the parent keeps its header and all scenarios, split-off behaviors become ADDED requirements with new scenarios. A live scenario never moves to an ADDED block (OpenSpec refuses it).
3. Form c2, REMOVED plus ADDED under new names: the only form that may rename or re-home scenarios. OpenSpec does not check scenarios here, so the ledger is mandatory.
4. Form d, RENAMED plus MODIFIED under the new name: renames only.
**Decision**: Read the text of each requirement and choose by this table, in this order.

| The excess is | Form |
| --- | --- |
| Examples, lists, formats or reasons around one behavior | a |
| Several behaviors, and every old scenario fits the parent that stays | b |
| Several behaviors, and old scenarios belong to different behaviors | c2 |
| Only the name must change | d, alone |

**Rationale**: Most cli requirements state several rules, so b and c2 are the common remedy and a is second. The kind labels of the inventory are a heuristic and do not decide. A MODIFIED body that stays over 500 passes `validate <change> --strict` but fails `validate --specs --strict` after archive, so every unit measures after archive. Unsafe pairs on one name (MODIFIED with ADDED, MODIFIED with REMOVED, ADDED with REMOVED, RENAMED with REMOVED or ADDED) are never written.

### What counts as shortening
**Context**: The validator counts the body lines between the header and the first `#` line, minus blank lines, fenced lines and `**Key**:` lines. Three loopholes pass the check without removing a rule.
**Decision**: The body itself must get shorter by moving text to scenarios or other requirements. No `**Key**:` line (only `**Reason**:` and `**Migration**:` inside REMOVED), no heading of level 5 or deeper, no fenced block, in a changed body.
**Rationale**: A loophole keeps the long text and defeats the point of the check.

### One change, eight units
**Context**: The repo rules ask for about five sections and a block above that (`openspec/config.yaml` proposal and tasks rules, Principle VIII).
**Options considered**:
1. One change in ten sections (eight batches, the gate extras, the final gate): one archive, one history, one ledger. Exceeds the "about five".
2. Several changes: breaks the single-ledger view, and each change must archive in turn on the same specs.
**Decision**: Option 1. The owner chose one change per repo and several units in sequence on one branch (swarm DECISIONS.md 2026-10-19 09:50).
**Rationale**: Each section still satisfies both invariants of Principle VIII: it ends green under `task openspec:check` (non-strict until the gate section) and closes with its own commit. The sections are uniform batches, not ten different designs. The proposal gate confirms this deviation from the "about five" wording.

## Sections

| Section | Content | Long requirements | Cumulative |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 to 8 | cli-B1 to cli-B8 | 28, 28, 28, 28, 28, 28, 28, 19 | 28, 56, 84, 112, 140, 168, 196, 215 |
| 9 | Restore `--strict` in `Taskfile.yml`, `AGENTS.md`, `openspec/config.yaml` | none | 215 |
| 10 | Final gate | none | 215 |

Order of the batches: B1 to B8 in the inventory order, which is by size, largest first. No order is forced by a collision: the cli has no open change (only `archive/`), so no `MODIFIED` of another author can go stale. B1 holds the two largest specs (`operator-lifecycle` 17, `apply-pruning` 11), so the form choices are settled there on the most requirements, and B8, the smallest, runs last. Section 9 runs after every batch, because `--strict` fails until all 215 are rewritten.

Each batch writes its delta files under `specs/<spec>/spec.md` of this change, one per spec, and no delta for a spec outside the batch. A delta file holds only the requirements the batch rewrites.

## The scenario ledger

Each unit appends one subsection per rewritten requirement to this file, under a heading `### Ledger: <spec>, <requirement header>`. A unit that rewrites nothing adds none.

Scenario table, one row per old scenario:

| Old scenario name | New place (requirement, scenario name) | Changed text? |
| --- | --- | --- |

- Forms a, b, d: every old name stays under the same requirement, byte for byte.
- Form c2: every old name must reappear in one of the new requirements, because OpenSpec does not check it. Moved scenarios keep WHEN and THEN byte for byte.

Clause table, when a clause leaves the body: old clause, new place (body clause or scenario THEN line). A clause that moves from a body SHALL to a scenario THEN keeps its SHALL, and only a default or an exact value moves this way. A clause that adds or changes a condition stays in the body. A separate behavior goes to form b or c2.

Other ledger rules for this repo:

- RFC 2119 keywords stay in every body, with the same strength.
- Citations (an enhancement id beside a reason in words, a `Source:` line) stay in the body of the block that carries the rule they support, never in the header. The repo rule is that an enhancement id never stands alone and is never a decision number; a rewrite copies the old wording and adds no new citation. A `Source:` line counts toward 500; `**Source**:` does not, and is a loophole.
- Before a rename, split or c2, grep the repo for the old header text outside `openspec/changes/archive/`. A stale reference is fixed in the same unit.
- Every new ADDED requirement has at least one scenario with a body and states SHALL or MUST. `openspec/config.yaml` asks scenarios to show observable behavior and user-facing outcomes; a scenario added for a new requirement uses only words and values of the old text. A scenario that adds a case absent from the old text is a question for the human, not a rewrite.
- No spec has a placeholder Purpose today (checked on `origin/main`), so no unit writes Purpose text. A c2 or b rewrite does not create a spec, so none appears.

## The gate

Every unit runs the gate in a scratch copy of the folder `openspec/`, never in the worktree. The worktree path is `<repo>/agent-swarm/openspec-requirement-split/worktrees/cli-split-long-requirements`. The pinned CLI is 1.14.1 (`Taskfile.yml` `openspec:install`). The gate block is guide section 6, run in one shell call: archive `main` and the working copy into `$S/base` and `$S/openspec`; count WARNING lines of `validate --all --strict` before; `validate split-long-requirements --strict`; `archive split-long-requirements --yes`; `validate --all --strict` after; fail on any "Archive would refuse" line, on any ERROR item that `main` does not have (compared as a set of type, id and path, needs `jq`), and, for an earlier unit, when the WARNING count did not fall by N. N is the total of requirements rewritten so far by all units, 28 after section 1 and so on (the table above). Exit 0 only after `GATE PASS`.

- Each unit also runs `openspec validate <spec> --type spec --strict --json 2>&1` for its specs and reads that no rewritten requirement has a WARNING or an ERROR.
- Each unit checks every moved or kept scenario byte for byte against `main` with the guide's checklist item 3 script, run in the worktree root once per rewritten requirement. A `DIFF` or `LOST` line is a failure.
- Section 10 is the last unit (`LAST=1`): `validate split-long-requirements --strict` exits 0, `validate --specs --strict` exits 0 after archive in the scratch copy, no "Archive would refuse" line, no new ERROR item. Then, with the extras of section 9 in place, `task openspec:check` runs in the worktree and must exit 0. In the cli no other change is open, so `validate --all --strict` also exits 0 at that point.
- This is the same check that CI runs after section 9 (`validate --all --strict` through `task openspec:check`, jobs "OpenSpec Specs (strict)").

## Risks and trade-offs

- A rewrite can drop a clause without any tool error (form c2 and moved clauses). The mitigations are the ledger, the byte check and the review checklist of the guide, run per unit by the reviewer.
- A long MODIFIED passes `validate <change> --strict` and fails only after archive. The gate catches it; a pre-archive check alone does not.
- A stale reference to a removed header is invisible to OpenSpec. The grep rule above is the only guard.
- Another change that lands on a spec of a later batch before that batch runs would make its MODIFIED blocks stale. A unit re-reads the spec from `main` of its worktree first; the supervisor merges `main` into the branch before a unit if `main` moved.

## Open questions

- Confirm at the proposal gate that ten sections in one change are accepted, as the owner ruled on 2026-10-19 09:50, although the repo wording says "about five".
