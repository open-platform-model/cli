## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: First install over resources OPM already manages warns

On a first-time apply (no `ModuleInstance` record), when one or more rendered resources already exist in the cluster with an OPM managed-by label, `opm instance apply` and `opm module apply` SHALL print one warning on the log stream before any rendered resource is applied. The warning SHALL give the number of such resources and the number of rendered resources, and SHALL say that the instance has no `ModuleInstance` record, that an apply updates those resources in place and records them, and that it prunes nothing. The warning SHALL NOT change the exit code and SHALL NOT stop the apply.

A dry run SHALL print the warning too. It SHALL read the rendered resources for this purpose only and SHALL refuse nothing because of that read: a resource the real run would refuse SHALL end the look without a warning and without an error. The dry-run warning SHALL name the release to apply with first (`v1.0.0-beta.10`) when an older release recorded the instance in a Secret.

The warning of a real run SHALL NOT send the user to that release, because the run writes the record and that release then deletes the Secret without reading it. It SHALL name the Secret (`opm.<name>.<id>`), SHALL say to keep it and not to apply with an older release, and SHALL name the docs page that describes the cleanup.

The apply SHALL print no such warning when no rendered resource exists yet, or when the instance has a record. `opm operator install` SHALL NOT print it: install applies the render's CustomResourceDefinitions itself before the instance apply, so a fresh install always finds them.

#### Scenario: Existing managed resources on a first install

- **WHEN** `opm instance apply` runs for an instance with no `ModuleInstance` record
- **AND** two of its three rendered resources already exist with the OPM managed-by label
- **THEN** the command SHALL print one warning that names 2 of 3 resources, the missing record and the Secret `opm.<name>.<id>`
- **AND** the warning SHALL NOT name `v1.0.0-beta.10`
- **AND** the apply SHALL go on and exit 0 when it succeeds

#### Scenario: Dry run warns before anything is written

- **WHEN** `opm instance apply --dry-run` runs for an instance with no `ModuleInstance` record
- **AND** two of its three rendered resources already exist with the OPM managed-by label
- **THEN** the command SHALL print one warning that names 2 of 3 resources and the release `v1.0.0-beta.10`
- **AND** no record SHALL be written

#### Scenario: Dry-run look refuses nothing

- **WHEN** `opm instance apply --dry-run` runs for an instance with no `ModuleInstance` record
- **AND** a rendered resource exists without OPM labels
- **THEN** the dry run SHALL NOT fail because of that resource and SHALL print no such warning

#### Scenario: Operator install prints no warning

- **WHEN** `opm operator install` runs on a cluster with no operator
- **THEN** the command SHALL print no such warning

#### Scenario: Clean first install prints no warning

- **WHEN** `opm instance apply` runs for an instance with no `ModuleInstance` record
- **AND** none of its rendered resources exists
- **THEN** the command SHALL print no such warning

#### Scenario: Instance with a record prints no warning

- **WHEN** `opm instance apply` runs for an instance that has a `ModuleInstance` record
- **THEN** the command SHALL print no such warning
