## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Pre-apply existence check on first install

On first-time apply (no previous inventory), the system SHALL check each rendered resource against the cluster. If a resource exists with a `deletionTimestamp` (terminating), or exists without OPM labels (untracked), the apply SHALL fail with a clear error message. This check SHALL be skipped entirely when a previous inventory exists. The untracked-resource error SHALL NOT name a flag that would bypass it, since no flag does; it SHALL tell the user to remove or rename the existing resource, or to change the module so it renders a different name.

#### Scenario: Untracked resource detected on first install

- **WHEN** performing a first-time apply
- **AND** a rendered resource already exists on the cluster without OPM labels
- **THEN** the command SHALL fail with an error indicating the resource is untracked

#### Scenario: Terminating resource detected on first install

- **WHEN** performing a first-time apply
- **AND** a rendered resource exists on the cluster with a `deletionTimestamp`
- **THEN** the command SHALL fail with an error indicating the resource is terminating

#### Scenario: Check skipped when inventory exists

- **WHEN** performing a subsequent apply (previous inventory exists)
- **THEN** the pre-apply existence check SHALL be skipped entirely

#### Scenario: Untracked-resource error names no bypass flag

- **WHEN** performing a first-time apply
- **AND** a rendered resource already exists on the cluster without OPM labels
- **THEN** the error SHALL NOT mention `--force`
- **AND** the error SHALL tell the user to remove or rename the existing resource, or to change the module to render a different name

### Requirement: Stale resources pruned after successful apply

After all rendered resources have been successfully applied, stale resources SHALL be deleted in reverse weight order (highest weight first — custom resources before CRDs). Deletion SHALL treat 404 as success (resource already gone). A `Namespace` in the core API group and a `CustomResourceDefinition` in the `apiextensions.k8s.io` group SHALL never be pruned, with no flag to override this: deleting a Namespace deletes everything inside it, and deleting a CRD deletes every custom resource of its kind in the cluster. Every stale resource of a protected kind SHALL be reported as left behind, one line per resource naming its kind, namespace and name with the status `left behind`.

#### Scenario: Stale resources deleted in reverse weight order

- **WHEN** the stale set contains a Deployment (weight 100) and a ConfigMap (weight 15)
- **THEN** the Deployment SHALL be deleted before the ConfigMap

#### Scenario: Already-deleted stale resource

- **WHEN** a stale resource no longer exists on the cluster
- **THEN** the prune operation SHALL treat the 404 as success

#### Scenario: Namespace excluded from pruning

- **WHEN** the stale set contains a Namespace resource
- **THEN** the Namespace SHALL NOT be pruned

#### Scenario: CRD excluded from pruning

- **WHEN** the stale set contains a `CustomResourceDefinition` in the `apiextensions.k8s.io` group
- **THEN** the CRD SHALL NOT be deleted
- **AND** the other stale resources SHALL still be pruned

#### Scenario: Protected stale resources are reported as left behind

- **WHEN** the stale set contains a Namespace and a CRD
- **THEN** the apply output SHALL list both with the status `left behind`
- **AND** the apply SHALL NOT fail because of them

#### Scenario: Same kind name in another group is not protected

- **WHEN** the stale set contains a resource of kind `Namespace` whose API group is not the core group
- **THEN** that resource SHALL be pruned like any other stale resource

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Dry-run prune preview lists left-behind resources

When `--dry-run` is set and pruning is enabled, the apply SHALL list the stale resources a real apply would prune, each with the status `would prune`, and SHALL list separately each stale resource of a protected kind (core `Namespace`, `apiextensions.k8s.io` `CustomResourceDefinition`) with the status `left behind`. The preview SHALL use the same protected-kind rule as the real prune, so the two lists together cover the whole stale set. With `--no-prune`, neither list SHALL be printed.

#### Scenario: Preview separates pruned and left-behind resources

- **WHEN** `opm instance apply --dry-run` runs with a stale set holding a ConfigMap, a Namespace and a CRD
- **THEN** the output SHALL list the ConfigMap as `would prune`
- **AND** the output SHALL list the Namespace and the CRD as `left behind`
- **AND** nothing SHALL be deleted

#### Scenario: No-prune dry run lists nothing

- **WHEN** `opm instance apply --dry-run --no-prune` runs with a non-empty stale set
- **THEN** the output SHALL list no `would prune` and no `left behind` lines
